Welcome to Tyler's banner converter!

This program currently supports minecraft 1.13-1.20.4

I plan to support other versions in the future, I built this for myself to use on 1.18

An executible can be downloaded from the github releases page, but if you want to build this yourself:

This program can be run using python, or built into an executible using pyinstaller.

first, install pyperclip so you have the dependencies.

then, install pyinstaller. navigate to the folder with the .py file and run

pyinstaller --onefile letter-banners.py

Thank you for downloading :)
