Welcome to Tyler's banner converter!

This program currently supports minecraft 1.13-1.20.4

I plan to support other versions in the future, I built this for myself to use on 1.18


This program can be run using python, or built into an executible using pyinstaller.

first, install pyinstaller. navigate to the folder with the .py file and run

pyinstaller --onefile letter-banners.py

If you would like to skip this step, an executible can be downloaded from the github releases page.

Thank you for downloading :)
